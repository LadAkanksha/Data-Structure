# Data-Structure

Data structures in C provide methods for organizing and storing data efficiently. They are fundamental for developing robust and optimized software. C supports both primitive and non-primitive data structures.

* Primitive Data Structures
  These are fundamental data types built into the C language:
    int: Integer numbers.
    float: Single-precision floating-point numbers.
    double: Double-precision floating-point numbers.
    char: Single characters.
  
* Non-Primitive Data Structures
These are derived from primitive types and offer more complex ways to store data:

Arrays:
  - Contiguous memory locations storing elements of the same data type.
  - Fixed size, requiring predefinition of size.
  - Elements accessed by index.

Linked Lists:
  - Collection of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node.
  - Dynamic size, allowing for insertion and deletion of elements.
  - Different types: singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.

Stacks:
  - LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
  - Operations: push (add element), pop (remove element), peek (view top element).

Queues:
  - FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
  - Operations: enqueue (add element), dequeue (remove element).

Trees:
  - Hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes.
  - Types: binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.
  - 
Graphs:
  - Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
  - Represent relationships between data.
  - 
Structures:
  - User-defined data type to group items of possibly different types. 

Common Operations on Data Structures:
    Searching: Finding a specific element.
    Sorting: Arranging elements in a specific order.
    Insertion: Adding new elements.
    Deletion: Removing elements.
    Updating: Modifying existing elements.
